## Inspiration
Our Main inspiration were our difficulties to find a job without forgetting our total ignorance of the process

## What it does
It is an end to end personal assistant for unemployed people looking for a job or newly graduated students. It aims to facilitate the searching and adaptation process

## How we built it
We built it using web technologies and intelligent systems to provide best recommendations and assistance to the users. With a good care of the monetizing aspects

## Challenges we ran into
Finding the idea it self, since it is hard to think that a digital solution can really assist such a messy process

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
we are proud of making this solution happen, as well as pushing it as far as possible in how can it be beneficial for the people in the need of an employment

## What we learned
We learnt a lot about assistance field, what technologies and systems can help us provide such a solution. And of course, how to make it as simple as possible

## What's next for Hira (MadShell)
How about make Hira able to provide assitance in more than job looking field ?
